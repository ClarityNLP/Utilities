Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

Report new malignancies that are different than the disease/disorder for which HCT was performed.  Do not include relapse, progression or transformation of the same disease
subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

Report new malignancies that are different than the disease/disorder for which HCT was performed.  Do not include relapse, progression or transformation of the same disease
subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period.

Expiration Date: 1/31/2020

Public Burden Statement:  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.  The OMB control number for this project is 0915-0310.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.25 hours per response when collected
at 100 days post-transplant, 1.15 hours per response when collected at 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, and 1.15 hours per response annually thereafter, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to HRSA Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-29, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.

HCT type: (check all that apply)

Product type: (check all that apply)

(Optional for Non-U.S. Centers)

This section is for allogeneic HCTs only.  If this was an autologous HCT, continue to Liver Toxicity Prophylaxis.

List the stage for each organ at diagnosis of acute GVHD:

Specify the maximum overall grade of acute GVHD since the date of last report

Specify the maximum grade of chronic GVHD since the date of last report:

Specify if the recipient developed VOD/SOS since the date of last report:

Report new malignancies that are different than the disease/disorder for which HCT was performed.  Do not include relapse, progression or transformation of the same disease
subtype.

The submission of a pathology report or other supportive documentation for each reported new malignancy is strongly recommended. 

This section relates to chimerism studies from allogeneic HCTs using cord blood units only.  If this was an autologous HCT, or an allogeneic HCT using a bone marrow or PBSC
product, continue to disease assessment.

Provide date(s), method(s) and other information for all chimerism studies performed since the date of last report.

Specify the method(s) used to assess the disease status at the time of best response:

Report therapy given since the date of last report to prevent relapse or progressive disease.  This may include maintenance and consolidation therapy.  Do not report any therapy
given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.

Report if the recipient has experienced a clinical/hematologic relapse or progression post HCT. If the relapse or progression was detected in a previous reporting period
indicate that and continue on.  If the first clinical/hematologic relapse occurred since the date of last report, indicate the date it was first detected in this reporting period. 

Intervention for relapsed disease, persistent disease, progressive disease, or decreased/loss of chimerism

Specify the method(s) of detection for which intervention was given:

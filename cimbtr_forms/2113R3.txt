HCT type: (check all that apply)

Product type: (check all that apply)

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion. When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease status to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion. This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT  or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval. If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Product type: (check all that apply)

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion. When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease status to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion. This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT  or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval. If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

What is the current disease status?112

Complete
remission (CR)

­ no lymphadenopathy; no organomegaly; neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; platelets > 100 x 109/L; hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL; lymphocytes < 4 x 109/L; bone
marrow < 30% lymphocytes; absence of constitutional symptoms 

Partial
remission
(PR)

­ ≥ 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from pretreatment value; ≥ 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy if present pretreatment; ≥ 50% reduction
in liver and spleen size if enlarged pretreatment; one or more of the following: neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L or 50% improvement over baseline, platelets > 100 x
109/L or 50% improvement over baseline, hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline

Stable disease (SD) - no change; not complete remission, partial remission, nor progressive disease

Progressive
disease
(Prog)

­ one or more of the following: ≥ 50% increase in sum of products of ≥ 2 lymph nodes (≥ 1 node must be ≥ 2 cm) or new nodes; ≥ 50% increase in liver or
spleen size or new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; ≥ 50% increase in absolute lymphocyte count to ≥ 5 x 109/L; transformation to a more aggresive

HCT type: (check all that apply)

Product type: (check all that apply)

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion. When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease status to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion. This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT  or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval. If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

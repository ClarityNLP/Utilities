1  Compared to the disease status prior to the preparative regimen, what was the best response to HCT since the date of the last report?

    (Include response to any therapy given for post-HCT maintenance or consolidation, but exclude any therapy given for relapsed, persistent, or progressive disease.)  

 
Continued complete remission (CCR)  - for patients transplanted in CR 

 
Complete remission (CR)  - normalization of WBC and organomegaly 

 
Partial remission (PR)  - ≥50% reduction in WBC and/or organomegaly 

 
Marginal response 

(MR)  

- between 25% and 50% reduction in WBC and organomegaly~ or ~partial response in organomegaly but no change in organomegaly~ or ~partial 

response in organomegaly but no change in WBC  

 
Stable disease (SD)  - ≤ 25% reduction in WBC and/or organomegaly 

 
Progressive disease (PD)  - increase in WBC and/or organomegaly 

 
Progression to AML  - ≥ 20% blasts in the bone marrow

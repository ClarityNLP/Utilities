Best response is based on response to the HSCT, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HSCT. When determining the best 
response to HSCT, compare the post-HSCT disease status to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen, regardless of time since HSCT. This comparison is meant to 
capture the BEST disease status in response to HSCT that occurred in the reporting interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting 
interval. If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous reporting interval, confirm the best response and check the box to indicate "date previously reported."  

 
1  Compared to the disease status prior to the preparative regimen, what was the best response to HSCT since the date of the last report? (Include response to planned post-HSCT 

tretament.) 

    
 nmlkji

CR  - disappearance of all target lesions for a period of at least one month 

 nmlkji
CRU  - Complete response with persistent imaging abnormalities of unknown significance. 

 nmlkji
PR  - at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions) taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters 

 nmlkji
SD  

- neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters since the treatment 
started 

 nmlkji
PD  - at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions), taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded 

since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  

 nmlkji
NA

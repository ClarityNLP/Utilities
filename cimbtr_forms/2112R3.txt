HCT type: (check all that apply)

Product type: (check all that apply)

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Product type: (check all that apply)

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."

Best response is based on response to the HCT or cellular therapy, but does NOT include response to any therapy given for disease relapse or progression post-HCT / post-
infusion.  When determining the best response, compare the post-HCT / post-infusion disease to the status immediately prior to the preparative regimen or cellular therapy,
regardless of time since HCT or infusion.  This comparison is meant to capture the BEST disease status in response to HCT or cellular therapy that occurred in the reporting
interval, even if a subsequent disease relapse or progression occurred during the same reporting interval.  If a recipient already achieved their best response in a previous
reporting interval, confirm the best response and check "yes" to indicate "date previously reported."
